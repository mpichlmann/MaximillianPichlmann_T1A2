    <p>Hi, I’m Maximillian Pichlmann, an aspiring IT professional. I love all things technology and design which is why I’m currently enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development course at Coder Academy and will graduate 2023 with a Diploma of IT.</p>
    <p>Prior to enrolling in Coder Academy I completed a Bachelor of Psychology and a Bachelor of Justice at the Queensland University of Technology in 2022 wherein I gained valuable professional skills. I am trained in statistical analysis, research design, theoretical deconstruction, and how to synthesise all of these into well-written reports. </p>
    <p>My hobbies outside of study are: gaming, chess, running, and video editing. My favourite game is Bioshock, my favourite chess opening is The London System, and my favourite run is a nice 5km. </p>
    <p> I love watching well edited highlight reels of gaming and sports, which has inspired me to learn how to make my own. 
    I’ve learnt a lot so far and I’m proud of all the skills I’ve acquired, but there’s always more to learn! </p>
