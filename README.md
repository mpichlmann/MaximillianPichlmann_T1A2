## Description of my portfolio website
### Purpose
To demonstrate my abilities as a developer and a designer, as well as to showcase some of my best work and highlight my skills. My portfolio will also share my interests, hobbies, experiences and who I am as a person. 

### Functionality & Features 
* The portfolio consists of 5 separate 'main' pages: Home, Skills, Works, Blog, and Contact, which are navigated through the use of a navbar that can always be found at the top of the page. The navbar contains animations that tell the user which page they are currently on as well as which page they are about to visit when they hover their mouse over it. 
* All pages are designed responsively and elements on the page will shift position and resize to maintain a neat and well organised layout according to the device and/or screen size. 
* The 'Home' page is the default page that visitors are presented with. It contains a short biography of myself as well as a picture. 
* The 'Skills' page is dedicated to informing visitors of my relevant IT skills through the use of displaying images and accompanying text, organised into discrete sections. This page also contains a highly visible link to a pdf of my resume, for those who would like to know more about my skills and experience. 
* The 'Works' page, which displays some of the work I have produced thus far. The content of this page is intelligently embedded and laid out, for ease of use and visibility to visitors of the page. 
* The 'Blog' page contains a list of sub-pages that visitors can click on, linking to an individual blog post that visitors can browse at their leisure. On each individual blog page the navbar remains present, and the visitor is presented with a 'go back' button at the top and bottom of the blog post for if they would like to return to the list of blog pages. 
* The 'Contact' page contains links to all of my relevant professional and social accounts, displayed with easily recogniseable logos and sub headings underneath, all of which can be clicked in order to visit the desired page. Similar to the navbar, these graphical/text links contain animations that inform the user which link they are about to click on.
